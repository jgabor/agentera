## 3. Decision Confidence Labels

Used in DECISIONS.md entries (produced by resonera, consumed by realisera, planera, inspektera, profilera).

| Label | Meaning | How consuming skills treat it |
|-------|---------|-------------------------------|
| **firm** | User is committed | Treat as a hard constraint |
| **provisional** | Best current answer, open to revision | Treat as a strong default |
| **exploratory** | Direction to try, expected to be revisited | Treat as a suggestion |

**Linter check**: Deterministic. Enum values in DECISIONS.md format definition.

## 4. Artifact Format Contracts

Each skill-maintained artifact has an expected structure. Producing skills define the format; consuming skills depend on it.

### Default layout

Three project-facing files at the project root; nine operational files in `.agentera/`.

**Root (project-facing)**:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| VISION.md | Project north star |
| TODO.md | Actionable items with priority and checkboxes |
| CHANGELOG.md | Version-level change summaries (keep-a-changelog) |

**.agentera/ (operational)**:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| PROGRESS.md | Cycle-by-cycle operational log |
| DECISIONS.md | Reasoning trail |
| PLAN.md | Active work plan |
| HEALTH.md | Audit grades and findings |
| OBJECTIVE.md | Optimization target |
| EXPERIMENTS.md | Experiment log |
| DESIGN.md | Visual identity |
| DOCS.md | Documentation contract + optional artifact path overrides |
| SESSION.md | Timestamped session bookmarks with artifact change tracking |
| archive/ | Completed plans, superseded visions and designs |

**PROFILE.md** is global at `~/.claude/profile/PROFILE.md`, not in the project root or `.agentera/`. Skills read it from this path directly.

### Format contracts

| Artifact | Path | Producer | Consumers | Key structural elements |
|----------|------|----------|-----------|------------------------|
| VISION.md | VISION.md | visionera, realisera | realisera, planera, inspektera, dokumentera, visualisera, orkestrera | ## North Star, ## Who It's For, ## Principles, ## Direction, ## Identity |
| TODO.md | TODO.md | realisera, inspektera | realisera, planera, orkestrera | ## ⇶ Critical, ## ⇉ Degraded, ## → Normal, ## ⇢ Annoying, ## Resolved |
| CHANGELOG.md | CHANGELOG.md | realisera | project contributors | ## [Unreleased], ### Added/Changed/Fixed |
| DECISIONS.md | .agentera/DECISIONS.md | resonera | planera, realisera, inspektera, profilera, optimera, orkestrera | ## Decision N · date, **Question/Context/Alternatives/Choice/Reasoning/Confidence/Feeds into** |
| PLAN.md | .agentera/PLAN.md | planera | realisera, inspektera, orkestrera | <!-- Level/Created/Status -->, ## Tasks with ### Task N, **Status/Depends on/Acceptance** |
| PROGRESS.md | .agentera/PROGRESS.md | realisera | planera, inspektera, dokumentera, visionera, orkestrera | ## Cycle N · date, **Phase/What/Commit/Inspiration/Discovered/Next/Context** |
| HEALTH.md | .agentera/HEALTH.md | inspektera | realisera, planera, orkestrera | ## Audit N · date, **Dimensions/Findings/Overall/Grades**, per-dimension sections |
| OBJECTIVE.md | .agentera/OBJECTIVE.md | optimera | optimera | ## Metric, ## Target, ## Baseline, ## Constraints |
| EXPERIMENTS.md | .agentera/EXPERIMENTS.md | optimera | optimera | ## Experiment N · date, **Hypothesis/Method/Result/Conclusion** |
| DESIGN.md | .agentera/DESIGN.md | visualisera | realisera, visionera | Standard sections per DESIGN-spec.md |
| DOCS.md | .agentera/DOCS.md | dokumentera | all skills (path resolution) | ## Conventions, ## Artifact Mapping, ## Index |
| SESSION.md | .agentera/SESSION.md | session stop hook | session start hook, hej | ## YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM, Artifacts modified, Summary; compaction: 5 full + 20 one-line, oldest dropped |
| PROFILE.md | ~/.claude/profile/PROFILE.md | profilera | all skills (via effective_profile) | ## Category, ### Decision, inline conf metadata |

**Dual-write**: realisera writes both CHANGELOG.md (public, version-level summaries for project contributors) AND `.agentera/PROGRESS.md` (operational cycle-level detail for consuming skills). Consuming skills that need cycle detail read `.agentera/PROGRESS.md`; project contributors read CHANGELOG.md.

### CHANGELOG.md format convention

CHANGELOG.md follows the [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) convention:

```markdown
# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- description

### Changed
- description

### Fixed
- description

## [version] · YYYY-MM-DD

### Added
- description
```

Realisera appends entries under `## [Unreleased]` in the appropriate subsection (Added/Changed/Fixed) based on the conventional commit type (feat → Added, refactor → Changed, fix → Fixed). On version bumps, the Unreleased section is promoted to a versioned heading.

**Linter check**: Advisory. Flags missing structural elements as warnings, not errors.

### Token budgets

Per-artifact word limits. Producing skills check approximate word count before writing. If a write would exceed the budget, compact first (see Compaction thresholds below).

| Artifact | Scope | Budget |
|----------|-------|--------|
| PROGRESS.md | Per-cycle entry | ≤500 words |
| PROGRESS.md | Full file | ≤3,000 words |
| EXPERIMENTS.md | Per-experiment entry | ≤300 words |
| EXPERIMENTS.md | Full file | ≤2,500 words |
| HEALTH.md | Per-dimension assessment | ≤150 words |
| HEALTH.md | Full file | ≤2,000 words |
| DECISIONS.md | Per-decision entry | ≤200 words |
| TODO.md | Per-item entry | ≤100 words |
| CHANGELOG.md | Per-version section | ≤300 words |
| PLAN.md | Per-task entry | ≤100 words |
| PLAN.md | Full file | ≤2,500 words |
| VISION.md | Full file | ≤1,500 words |
| DESIGN.md | Full file | ≤2,000 words |
| DOCS.md | Full file | ≤2,000 words |

Budgets are guidelines, not hard blockers. A 510-word cycle entry is fine; a 1,200-word entry signals the write step lacks output constraints.

### Content exclusion

Artifacts store judgments, intent, reasoning, and context that would be lost without them: the non-derivable residue. Do not duplicate state retrievable from the project's files or history with a deterministic command.

| Exclude from artifacts | Retrieve from |
|------------------------|---------------|
| Files modified in a cycle | `git log --stat` |
| Function signatures from audits | `Grep` against source code |
| Dependency versions | Manifest files (package.json, go.mod, etc.) |
| Lines of code per module | `wc -l` or Glob + Read |
| Code snippets in PROGRESS.md | Commit diffs (`git show`) |
| Test names enumerated in findings | `Grep` against test files |

The test: if a reader can reconstruct the information from the project's current state or git history, it does not belong in the artifact.

### Compaction thresholds

Growing artifacts (PROGRESS.md, EXPERIMENTS.md) are compacted to cap read cost for consuming skills. Compaction runs when the producing skill writes a new entry.

**PROGRESS.md**, compacted by realisera when writing a new cycle entry:

| Tier | Entries | Format |
|------|---------|--------|
| Full detail | 10 most recent cycles | Standard cycle entry format |
| One-line archive | Cycles 11 through 50 | `Cycle N (YYYY-MM-DD): ≤15-word summary` |
| Dropped | Cycles older than 50 | Removed entirely |

When writing a new cycle: if >10 full-detail entries exist, collapse the oldest to one-line format under an `## Archived Cycles` heading (below the recent cycles). If >40 one-line entries exist, drop the oldest. One-line summaries preserve cycle number, date, and work-type, enough for trend analysis by consuming skills.

**EXPERIMENTS.md**, compacted by optimera when writing a new experiment:

| Tier | Entries | Format |
|------|---------|--------|
| Full detail | 8 most recent experiments | Standard experiment entry format |
| One-line archive | Experiments 9 through 30 | `EXP-N: ≤15-word result summary` |
| Dropped | Experiments older than 30 | Removed entirely |

Same logic: collapse oldest full-detail to one-line when >8 exist. Drop oldest one-line when >22 one-line entries exist. Archive section sits below recent experiments under an `## Archived Experiments` heading.

## 5. Artifact Path Resolution

The default artifact layout is deterministic (see Section 4, Default layout). Skills know where artifacts live by convention, so no discovery step is required for the default case.

`.agentera/DOCS.md` is checked ONLY for path overrides. If a project needs artifacts in non-default locations, dokumentera writes an Artifact Mapping section to `.agentera/DOCS.md` with custom paths. Skills use those paths instead of the defaults.

Every skill that reads or writes artifacts MUST include the artifact path resolution instruction. The canonical template:

```
### Artifact path resolution

Before reading or writing any artifact, check if .agentera/DOCS.md exists. If it has an
Artifact Mapping section, use the path specified for each canonical filename ({OWN_ARTIFACTS},
etc.). If .agentera/DOCS.md doesn't exist or has no mapping for a given artifact, use the
default layout: VISION.md, TODO.md, and CHANGELOG.md at the project root; all other artifacts
in .agentera/. This applies to all artifact references in this skill, including cross-skill
{reads_or_writes} ({CROSS_ARTIFACTS}).
```

Where:
- `{OWN_ARTIFACTS}` = the skill's own artifact filenames
- `{reads_or_writes}` = "reads", "writes", or "reads and writes" as appropriate
- `{CROSS_ARTIFACTS}` = artifacts from other skills that this skill accesses

The section MUST appear under "## State artifacts" (not under cross-skill integration or elsewhere).

**Linter check**: Deterministic. Section presence under correct parent heading, core sentence pattern matching.

## 11. Loop Guard

Skills that run autonomous loops (currently: realisera, optimera, orkestrera) MUST include an escalation rule to prevent runaway cycles producing bad work.

### The rule

When the skill detects 3 consecutive failed cycles, it MUST:

1. **Stop**: do not attempt a 4th cycle on the same problem
2. **Log**: file the failure pattern to TODO.md with context: what was attempted, what failed, and what the skill thinks is wrong
3. **Surface**: tell the user what happened and recommend a course of action
   (e.g., "/resonera to deliberate on the approach", "manual investigation needed", "dependency missing")

### Failure detection

Consecutive failures are detected by reading the last 3 entries in PROGRESS.md. A cycle counts as failed when:

- The commit was reverted or the verification step failed
- The cycle logged a blocker and pivoted to different work 3 times in a row
  (3 consecutive pivots = the available work surface is exhausted)
- The cycle's "Discovered" field logs the same issue that was supposed to be fixed

### Complementary mechanisms

Optimera's existing plateau detection in `analyze_experiments.py` detects experiment stagnation (no improvement over N iterations). The loop guard is complementary: plateau detection handles metric stagnation, escalation handles general execution failure. Both can trigger independently.

### Applicability

The escalation rule is REQUIRED for autonomous-loop skills: `realisera`, `optimera`, `orkestrera`.

Orkestrera uses retry-based failure detection (max 2 retries per task, escalation after 3 consecutive task failures) rather than PROGRESS.md consecutive-failure inspection.

Other skills MAY include loop guard language but are not required to. Their workflows are typically single-invocation and do not risk runaway cycles.

### SKILL.md structural requirement

Autonomous-loop skills MUST include loop guard language in their `## Exit signals` section, referencing the 3-failure threshold and either PROGRESS.md inspection (realisera, optimera) or retry-based task failure detection (orkestrera).

**Linter check**: Deterministic. For skills in the autonomous-loop set (realisera, optimera, orkestrera), check that the `## Exit signals` section contains both "3" (the threshold) and a reference to PROGRESS.md, consecutive failure detection, or retry-based task failure patterns (`loop-guard`). Orkestrera uses retry/task-based patterns instead of PROGRESS.md. Advisory for all other skills.

## 18. Staleness Detection

Stale artifacts mislead routing decisions and cause skills to act on outdated context. This section defines how staleness is detected and which artifacts each skill is expected to update.

### Skill-to-expected-artifact mapping

Each skill produces specific artifacts as part of its workflow. When a skill is dispatched (directly or via orkestrera), the artifacts listed here are the ones it is expected to have updated upon completion. This table is the authoritative lookup for staleness checks.

| Skill | Expected artifact outputs |
|-------|--------------------------|
| visionera | VISION.md |
| resonera | .agentera/DECISIONS.md |
| planera | .agentera/PLAN.md |
| realisera | .agentera/PROGRESS.md, TODO.md, CHANGELOG.md |
| optimera | .agentera/EXPERIMENTS.md, .agentera/OBJECTIVE.md |
| inspektera | .agentera/HEALTH.md, TODO.md |
| dokumentera | .agentera/DOCS.md |
| visualisera | .agentera/DESIGN.md |
| profilera | ~/.claude/profile/PROFILE.md |
| inspirera | (no owned artifact; findings are filed to TODO.md or fed into other skills) |
| orkestrera | (conductor; updates .agentera/PLAN.md task statuses and dispatches other skills) |
| hej | (router; reads artifacts but produces none) |

Skills that share an artifact (e.g., realisera and inspektera both write to TODO.md) are each expected to update it independently when dispatched. Staleness is checked per-skill, not per-artifact.

### Plan-relative staleness convention

When a plan exists (.agentera/PLAN.md with an active status), staleness is measured relative to the plan's creation date (the `Created` field in the plan's HTML comment metadata).

**Detection rule**: after a plan completes (all tasks `■ complete` or `skipped`), compare each dispatched skill against its expected artifacts. An artifact is **stale** if its last modification date (via `git log -1 --format=%aI -- <path>`) predates the plan's creation date AND the skill was dispatched at least once during the plan.

**What counts as dispatched**: a skill appears in at least one task's execution history during the plan. For orkestrera-driven plans, the dispatch log in PROGRESS.md cycle entries identifies which skills ran.

**Scope**: only artifacts listed in the mapping above are checked. Artifacts that a skill reads but does not produce (e.g., realisera reads VISION.md) are not staleness candidates for that skill.

**Handling stale findings**: stale artifacts are surfaced as context for the next plan cycle, not as errors. The consuming skill (orkestrera, inspektera) reports which artifacts are stale and which dispatched skills were expected to update them. This informs the next plan's task selection without blocking execution.

### Fallback: no plan context

When no active or recently completed plan exists (standalone skill invocation, ad-hoc inspektera audit, or hej session orientation), plan-relative detection is unavailable. The fallback heuristic applies:

**Fallback rule**: an artifact is considered potentially stale if it was not modified since the most recent PROGRESS.md cycle entry. If PROGRESS.md has no entries (fresh project), no staleness check applies.

The fallback is advisory, not authoritative. It surfaces artifacts that may need attention but does not carry the same signal strength as plan-relative detection (where the dispatched-skill relationship provides causal evidence of staleness).

**Linter check**: None. Staleness detection is a runtime convention consumed by orkestrera and inspektera, not a SKILL.md structural requirement.
