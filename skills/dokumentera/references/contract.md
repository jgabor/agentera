## 2. Severity Levels

Two severity vocabularies serve different purposes in the suite.

### Finding severity (audit output)

Used by skills that produce audit findings (inspektera, dokumentera, visualisera).

| Level | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **critical** | Broken functionality, security issue, data loss risk |
| **warning** | Works but poorly: fragile, confusing, or degraded |
| **info** | Minor: cosmetic, style, low-impact improvement |

### Issue severity (TODO.md)

Used by all skills that file to TODO.md.

| Level | Glyph | Meaning |
|-------|-------|---------|
| **critical** | ⇶ | Broken functionality, blocks progress |
| **degraded** | ⇉ | Works but poorly: slow, fragile, ugly |
| **normal** | → | Standard work: features, improvements, routine tasks |
| **annoying** | ⇢ | Cosmetic, minor friction, style nit |

### Mapping

When filing audit findings to TODO.md, map as follows:

| Finding severity | → | Issue severity |
|-----------------|---|----------------|
| critical | → | critical |
| warning | → | degraded or normal |
| info | → | annoying |

### TODO.md format convention

TODO.md uses a conventional checkbox format grouped by severity. Skills write items as Markdown checkboxes under severity headings:

```markdown
# TODO

## ⇶ Critical
- [ ] ISS-N: [type] Description

## ⇉ Degraded
- [ ] ISS-N: [type] Description

## → Normal
- [ ] ISS-N: [type] Description

## ⇢ Annoying
- [ ] ISS-N: [type] Description

## Resolved
- [x] ~~ISS-N: [type] Description~~ · resolved in commit hash
```

Type tags use the conventional commit vocabulary: feat, fix, docs, refactor, chore, test, perf.

The severity vocabulary (critical/degraded/annoying) is preserved as section headings with severity glyphs. Checkboxes indicate completion state. Resolved items move to the Resolved section with strikethrough and commit reference.

**Linter check**: Deterministic. Exact string matching for severity terms in context.

## 4. Artifact Format Contracts

Each skill-maintained artifact has an expected structure. Producing skills define the format; consuming skills depend on it.

### Default layout

Three project-facing files at the project root; nine operational files in `.agentera/`.

**Root (project-facing)**:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| VISION.md | Project north star |
| TODO.md | Actionable items with priority and checkboxes |
| CHANGELOG.md | Version-level change summaries (keep-a-changelog) |

**.agentera/ (operational)**:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| PROGRESS.md | Cycle-by-cycle operational log |
| DECISIONS.md | Reasoning trail |
| PLAN.md | Active work plan |
| HEALTH.md | Audit grades and findings |
| OBJECTIVE.md | Optimization target |
| EXPERIMENTS.md | Experiment log |
| DESIGN.md | Visual identity |
| DOCS.md | Documentation contract + optional artifact path overrides |
| SESSION.md | Timestamped session bookmarks with artifact change tracking |
| archive/ | Completed plans, superseded visions and designs |

**PROFILE.md** is global. The host runtime provides the path via the profile-path capability (Section 20). In Claude Code, this resolves to `~/.claude/profile/PROFILE.md`. <!-- platform: profile-path --> Skills read it from the runtime-provided path directly.

### Format contracts

| Artifact | Path | Producer | Consumers | Key structural elements |
|----------|------|----------|-----------|------------------------|
| VISION.md | VISION.md | visionera, realisera | realisera, planera, inspektera, dokumentera, visualisera, orkestrera | ## North Star, ## Who It's For, ## Principles, ## Direction, ## Identity |
| TODO.md | TODO.md | realisera, inspektera | realisera, planera, orkestrera | ## ⇶ Critical, ## ⇉ Degraded, ## → Normal, ## ⇢ Annoying, ## Resolved |
| CHANGELOG.md | CHANGELOG.md | realisera | project contributors | ## [Unreleased], ### Added/Changed/Fixed |
| DECISIONS.md | .agentera/DECISIONS.md | resonera | planera, realisera, inspektera, profilera, optimera, orkestrera | ## Decision N · date, **Question/Context/Alternatives/Choice/Reasoning/Confidence/Feeds into** |
| PLAN.md | .agentera/PLAN.md | planera | realisera, inspektera, orkestrera | <!-- Level/Created/Status -->, ## Tasks with ### Task N, **Status/Depends on/Acceptance** |
| PROGRESS.md | .agentera/PROGRESS.md | realisera | planera, inspektera, dokumentera, visionera, orkestrera | ## Cycle N · date, **Phase/What/Commit/Inspiration/Discovered/Next/Context** |
| HEALTH.md | .agentera/HEALTH.md | inspektera | realisera, planera, orkestrera | ## Audit N · date, **Dimensions/Findings/Overall/Grades**, per-dimension sections |
| OBJECTIVE.md | .agentera/OBJECTIVE.md | optimera | optimera | ## Metric, ## Target, ## Baseline, ## Constraints |
| EXPERIMENTS.md | .agentera/EXPERIMENTS.md | optimera | optimera | ## Experiment N · date, **Hypothesis/Method/Result/Conclusion** |
| DESIGN.md | .agentera/DESIGN.md | visualisera | realisera, visionera | Standard sections per DESIGN-spec.md |
| DOCS.md | .agentera/DOCS.md | dokumentera | all skills (path resolution) | ## Conventions, ## Artifact Mapping, ## Index |
| SESSION.md | .agentera/SESSION.md | session stop hook | session start hook, hej | ## YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM, Artifacts modified, Summary; compaction: 5 full + 20 one-line, oldest dropped |
| PROFILE.md | (profile-path capability) <!-- platform: profile-path --> | profilera | all skills (via effective_profile) | ## Category, ### Decision, inline conf metadata |

**Dual-write**: realisera writes both CHANGELOG.md (public, version-level summaries for project contributors) AND `.agentera/PROGRESS.md` (operational cycle-level detail for consuming skills). Consuming skills that need cycle detail read `.agentera/PROGRESS.md`; project contributors read CHANGELOG.md.

### HEALTH.md audit dimensions

Inspektera assesses codebases across these dimensions, selecting applicable ones per audit. Each dimension produces an A-F grade, confidence-scored findings, and trend tracking.

| Dimension | What it evaluates |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Architecture alignment | Code vs stated architecture: pattern drift, boundary violations, layering breaks |
| Pattern consistency | Naming, error handling, structure, abstractions used consistently |
| Coupling health | Hidden dependencies, circular imports, god modules, inappropriate intimacy |
| Complexity hotspots | Long functions, deep nesting, high fan-out, accumulated conditionals |
| Test health | Coverage gaps, test quality, test-to-code ratio, behavior vs implementation testing |
| Dependency health | Outdated deps, security advisories, unused deps, pinning discipline |
| Version health | Unreleased feat/fix commits since last version bump |
| Artifact freshness | State artifacts current relative to plan activity or recent development |
| Security hygiene | Hardcoded secrets, dangerous function calls, basic injection patterns (lightweight regex scan; recommends dedicated tools for comprehensive analysis) |

### CHANGELOG.md format convention

CHANGELOG.md follows the [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) convention:

```markdown
# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- description

### Changed
- description

### Fixed
- description

## [version] · YYYY-MM-DD

### Added
- description
```

Realisera appends entries under `## [Unreleased]` in the appropriate subsection (Added/Changed/Fixed) based on the conventional commit type (feat → Added, refactor → Changed, fix → Fixed). On version bumps, the Unreleased section is promoted to a versioned heading.

**Linter check**: Advisory. Flags missing structural elements as warnings, not errors.

### Token budgets

Per-artifact word limits. Producing skills check approximate word count before writing. If a write would exceed the budget, compact first (see Compaction thresholds below).

| Artifact | Scope | Budget |
|----------|-------|--------|
| PROGRESS.md | Per-cycle entry | ≤500 words |
| PROGRESS.md | Full file | ≤3,000 words |
| EXPERIMENTS.md | Per-experiment entry | ≤300 words |
| EXPERIMENTS.md | Full file | ≤2,500 words |
| HEALTH.md | Per-dimension assessment | ≤150 words |
| HEALTH.md | Full file | ≤2,000 words |
| DECISIONS.md | Per-decision entry | ≤200 words |
| TODO.md | Per-item entry | ≤100 words |
| CHANGELOG.md | Per-version section | ≤300 words |
| PLAN.md | Per-task entry | ≤100 words |
| PLAN.md | Full file | ≤2,500 words |
| VISION.md | Full file | ≤1,500 words |
| DESIGN.md | Full file | ≤2,000 words |
| DOCS.md | Full file | ≤2,000 words |

Budgets are guidelines, not hard blockers. A 510-word cycle entry is fine; a 1,200-word entry signals the write step lacks output constraints.

### Content exclusion

Artifacts store judgments, intent, reasoning, and context that would be lost without them: the non-derivable residue. Do not duplicate state retrievable from the project's files or history with a deterministic command.

| Exclude from artifacts | Retrieve from |
|------------------------|---------------|
| Files modified in a cycle | `git log --stat` |
| Function signatures from audits | `Grep` against source code |
| Dependency versions | Manifest files (package.json, go.mod, etc.) |
| Lines of code per module | `wc -l` or Glob + Read |
| Code snippets in PROGRESS.md | Commit diffs (`git show`) |
| Test names enumerated in findings | `Grep` against test files |

The test: if a reader can reconstruct the information from the project's current state or git history, it does not belong in the artifact.

### Compaction thresholds

Growing artifacts (PROGRESS.md, EXPERIMENTS.md) are compacted to cap read cost for consuming skills. Compaction runs when the producing skill writes a new entry.

**PROGRESS.md**, compacted by realisera when writing a new cycle entry:

| Tier | Entries | Format |
|------|---------|--------|
| Full detail | 10 most recent cycles | Standard cycle entry format |
| One-line archive | Cycles 11 through 50 | `Cycle N (YYYY-MM-DD): ≤15-word summary` |
| Dropped | Cycles older than 50 | Removed entirely |

When writing a new cycle: if >10 full-detail entries exist, collapse the oldest to one-line format under an `## Archived Cycles` heading (below the recent cycles). If >40 one-line entries exist, drop the oldest. One-line summaries preserve cycle number, date, and work-type, enough for trend analysis by consuming skills.

**EXPERIMENTS.md**, compacted by optimera when writing a new experiment:

| Tier | Entries | Format |
|------|---------|--------|
| Full detail | 8 most recent experiments | Standard experiment entry format |
| One-line archive | Experiments 9 through 30 | `EXP-N: ≤15-word result summary` |
| Dropped | Experiments older than 30 | Removed entirely |

Same logic: collapse oldest full-detail to one-line when >8 exist. Drop oldest one-line when >22 one-line entries exist. Archive section sits below recent experiments under an `## Archived Experiments` heading.

## 5. Artifact Path Resolution

The default artifact layout is deterministic (see Section 4, Default layout). Skills know where artifacts live by convention, so no discovery step is required for the default case.

`.agentera/DOCS.md` is checked ONLY for path overrides. If a project needs artifacts in non-default locations, dokumentera writes an Artifact Mapping section to `.agentera/DOCS.md` with custom paths. Skills use those paths instead of the defaults.

Every skill that reads or writes artifacts MUST include the artifact path resolution instruction. The canonical template:

```
### Artifact path resolution

Before reading or writing any artifact, check if .agentera/DOCS.md exists. If it has an
Artifact Mapping section, use the path specified for each canonical filename ({OWN_ARTIFACTS},
etc.). If .agentera/DOCS.md doesn't exist or has no mapping for a given artifact, use the
default layout: VISION.md, TODO.md, and CHANGELOG.md at the project root; all other artifacts
in .agentera/. This applies to all artifact references in this skill, including cross-skill
{reads_or_writes} ({CROSS_ARTIFACTS}).
```

Where:
- `{OWN_ARTIFACTS}` = the skill's own artifact filenames
- `{reads_or_writes}` = "reads", "writes", or "reads and writes" as appropriate
- `{CROSS_ARTIFACTS}` = artifacts from other skills that this skill accesses

The section MUST appear under "## State artifacts" (not under cross-skill integration or elsewhere).

**Linter check**: Deterministic. Section presence under correct parent heading, core sentence pattern matching.
